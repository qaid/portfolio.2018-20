A lot of my client work as a visual designer is in Identity Systems. I have a talent for translating business and organizational needs into an accessible - but unique - look and feel. From hand drawn work to carefully selected typefaces, I strive for lightness and balance. To arrive at these solutions I research and interview, sketch and iterate, getting to know the needs and tastes of clients as well as those of the patrons they aim to serve.
