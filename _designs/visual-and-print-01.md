As a DJ and lover of cutting rugs, I've been putting on parties and moving the crowd for a more than a decade. The FND SND (think _Found Sound_) event was based in Brooklyn and required all kinds of promotional materials, including a website, flyers, posters, and music mixes. The design I devised embraced the vowel-less trend of the moment, with a dash of grit and texture. I used a  pure vector design approach for the vinyl's lighting and material effect. Texture, typography, and atmosphere are important parts of my visual design work.
