The Scribble Art Workshop was an extracurricular program that needed a new look and an an ecommerce component. They had a number of fantastic photos showing the students at work as well as the results of their creative work. The goals I designed towards included presenting the program in a sophisticated and trustworthy way, along with making paths to registration and transactions simplistic and frictionless. I took into account that many of the site visitors would be frugal  parents with limited time and attention. I focused the attention of visitors with bold colors and balanced content blocking.
