My redesign of a dashboard app for NIPO Software was focused on modernizing the look of the interface and streamlining the workflows of the tasks that were possible for the customers. To build the product efficiently the team strongly embraced Google's Material Design approach. It also fit nicely with the front-end framework used in the project. My designs consisted of carefully considered and creatively arranged components that adhered to the theory behind Material Design concepts.
