Jazz, then back again. Jazz then, back again. Jazz then back. Again. [This mix](https://www.mixcloud.com/humble/jazz-then-back-again-part-1/) is full of mellow funk. The cover art for this mix was inspired by the art work for the Brass Company album "Colors." I used a fixed color pallet and limited shapes to convey the vibe of the mix. This was the first of a series of jazz mix cover designs, so I hid the number "1" in the design. Do you see it? The ability to work layers of meaning into a visual design is one of the intriguing and interesting aspects of design.
