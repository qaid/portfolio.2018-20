My most meaningful design challenges have come from the non-profit world where resources are modest and messaging is paramount. First hand drawn and then vectorized, I produced this custom lettering for an annual grassroots celebration of the liberation of oppressed people. Hip Hop culture was the prevailing influence since this identity and the supporting materials I created (website, flyers, and posters) were used to promote an urban concert and other events.
