I began to release monthly mixes in 2011 intended to be responses to current news events. The design behind both the visual and music design of this mix was the upheaval that had recently occurred in Egypt. There were plenty of photos that captured the excitement and jubilance of that revolutionary moment. In my composition I tried to capture those same elements along with the feelings of large scale and chaotic change that was promised as a result of the moment.
